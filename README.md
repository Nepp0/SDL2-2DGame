# SDL2-2DGame
*A simple 2D game built with SDL2*
# Overview

This project serves as a demonstration of my implementation of SDL2 through a basic 2D game.
This game features sprite-based rendering for both the main character and the background, with sprite frames updating dynamically within the render loop based on their width and height.

# Features

 **Sprite Animation** – Smooth character and background rendering

 **Dynamic Frame Updates** – Iterative sprite management in the render loop

 **Testing Assets** – Uses *Ken* from *Street Fighter III* and its soundtrack for testing purposes
